# 🗺️ Streetart Map – 161Männchen

Welcome to the digital home of the 161Männchen graffiti map!  
This project connects the spotted graffiti art from the streets with an interactive Folium map, making it easy to explore the artworks by location.

## 🌍 What is this?

This map is part of the [@161maennchen](https://www.instagram.com/161maennchen/) Instagram project – a curated collection of graffiti sightings featuring the iconic "161Männchen" character.  
I'm not the artist – just a big fan who documents these pieces wherever I find them, or where people send them in.

Now, thanks to this map, you can:

- See where each artwork was spotted
- View images of the graffiti in their urban context
- Explore the spread and creativity of 161Männchen across Jena/ Germany

Each pin on the map links to a photo and the location where the graffiti was found.

## 🛠️ How it works

- The map is built using [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) – a Python library for interactive maps
- It’s exported as a standalone `index.html` file and hosted for free via GitHub Pages
- No backend, no database – just a clean and simple HTML map
